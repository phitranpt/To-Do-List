## Weekend Challenge #3

Hello Primers! 

Welcome to your 3rd weekend challenge!

Full stack is pretty awesome, huh? The idea that you are able to spin up a full application architecture in such a short time is pretty incredible. This weekend is all about showing us that you have a handle on each of the different parts of the full stack. 

## The To-Do App

You are going to create a 'TO DO' application. This type of application is very common to tackle when learning a new language, which makes it extremely valuable to work through for the first time. Chances are good that at some point in your career you will tackle this again while learning another language.

### Styling

Use CSS styling to move the aesthetic of the page beyond the vanilla HTML look:

<!-- Background color of the page
font family and size
text color & or background color of tasks to show whether or not they have been completed -->

<!-- ### Approach

We would recommend you spend some time thinking about how to approach this problem. Think through all the logic that will be needed prior to writing any code. Take your time, relax, remember that impostor syndrome is real, and that you are capable of knocking this out of the park! -->

<!-- ### Create a Database

Be sure to create a new database through Postico. Use the name `weekend-to-do-app`. You will need to use this name in your database connection configuration on your server. -->

<!-- ### Database Structure

Please include a `database.sql` text file in your repo that includes all of your `CREATE TABLE` queries. This is so we can re-create your database while testing your app. -->

## Stretch Goals

For each of your strech goals, you will be practicing git branching. Please refer to the branching notes for a reminder on commands. Each branch will be merged into master using `--no-ff`. This will allow us to see that you branched your feature when you turn in your code.

- `feature-styling-bootstrap` 

    - [ ]  Add Bootstrap to the front end and style it up!
     -  Buttons
     -  Cards
     -  Jumbotron

- `feature-confirm-delete`

    - [ ]  In whatever fashion you would like, create an 'are you sure: yes / no' option when deleting a task.

- `feature-completed-task-ordering` 

    - [ ]  Adjust the logic so that completed tasks are brought to the bottom of the page, where the remaining tasks left to complete are brought to the top of the list.
